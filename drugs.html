<p class="pv3">
  The treatment of depression in adolescents is an area of
  burgeoning interest. Unfortunately, few well-controlled,
  large-scale, randomized clinical trials have been conducted
  in this population. Data from the 1,769 adolescents and young adult participants in the National Comorbidity
Survey (Kessler and Walters, 1998) indicate a lifetime prevalence
rate of 15.3% for major depression, comparable
with the 17% lifetime prevalence of depression in adults
(Kessler et al., 1994). As with adults, the course of major
depression in adolescents is often characterized by protracted
episodes, frequent recurrence, and impairment in
social and academic domains (Rao et al., 1995). Suicide is
the third leading cause of death in adolescents, and depressive
disorders are strongly correlated with suicide attempts
(Eisenberg, 1984; Kovacs et al., 1993). Depressed adolescents
grow up to be depressed adults and, compared with
healthy controls, have higher rates of suicide, psychiatric
and medical hospitalizations, and impairment in work,
family, and social lives (Weissman et al., 1999).</p>

<p class="pv3">
The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants has been investigated
in at least 11 double-blind, randomized studies
(Dulcan et al., 1998; Ryan and Varma, 1998), none demonstrating
superiority of active treatment over placebo.
However, methodological deficiencies in these studies,
including very small sample sizes and diagnostic heterogeneity,
limit statistical inference and generalizability of the
findings. At the same time, cardiovascular effects and
lethality in overdose associated with the tricyclic agents
have greatly limited their use in clinical practice.
Since the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
became commercially available, the safety, tolerability, and
efficacy of these agents in treating major depression in
adolescents have been noted in several open-label reports
(Ambrosini et al., 1999; Apter et al., 1994; Masi et al.,
1997; McConville et al., 1996; Rey-Sanchez and
Gutierrez-Casares, 1997; Rodriguez-Ramos et al., 1996;
Simeon et al., 1998). Placebo-controlled trials, which
remain the standard against which efficacy is determined,
number only two, both with fluoxetine (Emslie et al.,
1997; Simeon et al., 1990). A small study by Simeon and
associates (1990) was negative. In contrast, a large-scale
trial by Emslie and colleagues (1997) showed a 23% drugplacebo
difference in overall clinical improvement. The
findings of a third study, which used a historical casecontrol
design (Strober et al., 1999), suggested greater efficacy
of fluoxetine compared with imipramine in a severely
ill, inpatient population of adolescents with major depression.
We now report principal findings from the first double-blind,
placebo-controlled comparison of an SSRI,
paroxetine, and a placebo-controlled comparison with a
tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine, in the treatment of
adolescents with major depression.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="pt4">Methods:</h2>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Study Design:</span>
This was an 8-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, paralleldesign
comparison of paroxetine with placebo and imipramine with
placebo in adolescents with major depression. The trial was conducted
at 10 centers in the United States and 2 in Canada. Four hundred
twenty-five subjects were screened for eligibility, and 275
subjects were randomly assigned to experimental treatment. The trial
was conducted in accordance with good clinical practices and the
Helsinki Declaration. <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad1.png" alt=""> All subjects and their parent(s) provided
written informed consent before entry into the study; the identity of
all subjects is completely blinded in this report. Funding for this
study was provided by GlaxoSmithKline; each author had access to
data and signed off on the manuscript before it was submitted for
publication.
Patient Eligibility
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Patient Eligibility:</span>
Male and female subjects, aged 12 through 18 years, fulfilling the
DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria for a current
episode of major depression of at least 8 weeks in duration were
enrolled. Major depression was diagnosed by a systematic clinical interview
which used the juvenile version of the Schedule for <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad3.png" alt=""> Affective
Disorders and Schizophrenia for Adolescents-Lifetime version (KSADS-L)
rating scale. The K-SADS-L was developed by one of the
authors (R.G.K.) through modification of the adult SADS assessment
technique (Endicott and Spitzer, 1978) by providing uniform anchors
so that symptoms were specifically rated for clinical relevance and by
adding items to generate DSM-IV diagnoses. The K-SADS-L uses separate <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad4.png" alt="">
patient and parent reports to assess lifetime presence of affective
and schizophrenic disorders, as well as the full range of childhood and
adolescent psychopathological conditions. In addition to fulfilling
DSM-IV criteria for major depression, subjects were required to have a
total score of at least 12 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for
Depression (HAM-D), a score of less than 60 on the Children’s Global
Assessment Scale, and a score of at least 80 on the Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test. All subjects were medically healthy.
Potential subjects in the study were screened initially by telephone,
and candidates who were considered likely to meet diagnostic criteria
were evaluated at the study site. Adolescents and parents were interviewed
separately. For those cases in which there existed a significant
discrepancy between information provided by the adolescent and <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad5.png" alt="">
information provided by the parent, the clinician met with both to discuss
the information obtained and then rendered a rating. </p>

<p class="pv3">
  Eligible subjects
and their parent(s) were required to reach agreement with the site
investigator that the subject had a disorder requiring treatment. In
cases in which the diagnosis was not certain, audiotapes of the screening
interview were to be reviewed and the diagnosis was to be verified
further by an independent expert from another participating site prior
to certifying study eligibility.
Subjects with a current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar
disorder, schizoaffective disorder, eating disorder, alcohol or substance
use disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism/pervasive developmental
disorder, or organic brain disorder were excluded from consideration. <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad6.png" alt="">
A diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder within 12
months of recruitment was also exclusionary, as was current suicidal
ideation with intent or specific plan, a history of suicide attempts by
drug overdose, any medical condition in which the use of an antidepressant
was contraindicated, current psychotropic drug use, an adequate
trial of antidepressant medication within 6 months of study
entry, or exposure to investigational drug use either within 30 days of study entry or within five half-lives of the drug. Females who were
pregnant or breastfeeding and those who were sexually active and not
using reliable contraception were also excluded.</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Blinding, Randomization, and Treatment:</span>All subjects underwent a 7- to 14-day screening phase to determine
persistence and severity of entry diagnostic and eligibility criteria and
to obtain baseline global functioning scores, physical examination, and
clinical laboratory studies. Placebo was not administered during the
screening phase. By means of a computer-generated list, subjects who
still met entry criteria were randomly assigned to an 8-week course of
treatment with paroxetine, imipramine, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio.
Tablets were overencapsulated in matching Supro B locking capsules to
preserve medication blinding. Subjects assigned to paroxetine treatment
received 20 mg/day in the morning for weeks 1 through 4.
Optional dosage increases to 30 mg of paroxetine per day (divided
dose) were allowed at week 5 and to 40 mg per day (divided dose) at
weeks 6 through 8 if deemed necessary by the treating clinician.</p>

<p class="pv3"> Imipramine
treatment was initiated with a forced titration schedule in
which subjects received daily doses of 50 mg during week 1, 100 mg
during week 2, 150 mg during week 3, and 200 mg during week 4.
Thereafter, optional dosage increases to 250 mg/day (during week 5)
and to 300 mg/day (during weeks 6 through 8) were allowed if judged
necessary by the research study clinician. Imipramine administration
was divided between morning and evening for all daily doses of 100
mg or greater.
Subjects were instructed to take their medication twice daily, once in
the morning and again in the evening. The number of active drug or
matched placebo capsules administered per day was identical for each
treatment group during forced titration. During weeks 1 and 2, subjects
in the paroxetine or imipramine groups received one active drug
capsule in the morning and one active drug or matched placebo capsule
in the evening. Subjects in the placebo group received one capsule
in the morning and one in the evening. During week 3, subjects
received one active drug capsule in the morning and two active drug or
matched placebo capsules in the evening. At week 4, subjects received
one active drug capsule plus one matched placebo capsule in the morning
and two active drug or matched placebo capsules in the evening.
Beginning at week 5, subjects either remained at the week 4 dose level
(i.e., four capsules per day) or were titrated upward to five or six capsules
per day. Subjects who completed the study were offered the
option of continuing blinded treatment at the same dose for 6 additional
months. If subjects withdrew from the study prematurely for
any reason, the dose of medication was gradually tapered over a 7- to
17-day period.
Supportive case management was provided to all subjects at each
weekly clinic visit according to the method described by Fawcett
et al. (1987). Such management was limited to psychosocial interaction
that enabled observation of treatment effects. Interpersonal or
cognitive-behavioral psychotherapeutic interventions were strictly
prohibited.
</p>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Efficacy and Safety Evaluation:</span>
After randomization, subjects were seen at weekly intervals and evaluated
with standardized instruments and global assessments for efficacy.
The protocol described two primary outcome measures: (1)
response, which was defined as a HAM-D score of ≤8 or a ≥50%
reduction in baseline HAM-D score at the end of treatment; and (2)
change from baseline in HAM-D total score. Five other depressionrelated
variables were declared a priori: (1) change in the depressed
mood item of the HAM-D; (2) change in the depression item of the
K-SADS-L; (3) Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scores <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad7.png" alt="">
of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved); (4) change in the
nine-item depression subscale of the K-SADS-L; and (5) mean CGI
improvement scores.
Assessment of multiple domains of functioning, general health, and
behavior consisted of (1) Autonomous Function Checklist, completed
by the parent, which assessed the subject’s autonomy in performing
daily activities (Sigafoos et al., 1988); (2) Self-Perception Profile, completed
by the subject to measure self-esteem (Harter, 1988); and (3)
Sickness Impact Scale, completed by the subject, to measure present
health and quality of life (Bergner et al., 1981).
Adverse events, heart rate, blood pressure, and body weight were
determined at each weekly visit. Rhythm strip electrocardiograms <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad8.png" alt="">
(ECGs) were obtained at each visit, and 12-lead ECGs were obtained
during the screening phase and at weeks 4 and 8. Routine clinical laboratory
studies were conducted during the screening phase and at week
8, or upon study withdrawal.
If changes in cardiovascular parameters occurred, then dosage
reductions were required. Doses were reduced by 10 mg for paroxetine
doses of 30 mg or 40 mg; subjects receiving 20 mg of paroxetine were
withdrawn from the study. Similarly, imipramine doses of 250 mg or
300 mg per day were reduced by 50 mg, and subjects receiving ≤200
mg of imipramine were withdrawn from the study. Cardiovascular
parameters necessitating dosage reduction or study withdrawal were
defined prospectively as heart rate ≥110 beats per minute (bpm) at two <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad9.png" alt="">
consecutive visits or heart rate ≥130 bpm at a single visit; systolic
blood pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >85 mm Hg;
PR interval ≥0.21 seconds; QRS interval ≥0.12 seconds and ≥150%
of baseline; or QTC interval ≥0.48 seconds.
Blood samples were obtained from all patients at weeks 4 and 8 for
determination of plasma concentrations of imipramine, desmethylimipramine
(the major, pharmacologically active metabolite of imipramine),
and paroxetine. Subjects were withdrawn from the study if
the combined imipramine and desmethylimipramine concentration
exceeded 500 ng/mL.

</span>
</p>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Statistical Methods:</span>
A sample size of 90 patients per arm was required to provide
approximately 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.4 between an
active regimen and placebo with an α level of 5% (two-tailed). The
change from baseline in the HAM-D total score was used.
The efficacy analyses were performed on the population of <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad10.png" alt="">
patients who were randomized and had at least one postbaseline efficacy
evaluation. Two datasets from this population were examined:
(1) a last observation carried forward dataset in which the last observation
on treatment was carried forward to estimate missing data for
patients who withdrew prior to completing 8 weeks of treatment,
and (2) a completer dataset that examined results in patients who
received study medication for the full 8 weeks. Missing data were not
estimated for the completer dataset.
Continuous variables, such as changes from baseline to endpoint in
the HAM-D total score, CGI improvement scale, and K-SADS-L,
were analyzed by a two-factor analysis of variance using the general
linear model procedure of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). The <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad11.png" alt="">
model included terms for treatment and investigator. Categorical variables,
such as percentage of subjects responding to treatment, were
analyzed with logistic analysis implemented in the categorical modeling
procedure (CATMOD) of the SAS; the model included effects
for investigator and treatment. Pairwise comparisons between each
active treatment and placebo were two-tailed and performed at an α
level of .05. Data are reported as least square means (±SD or SE).
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="" onmouseenter="playAudio()"><span class="b"></span>
Treatment groups were similar with regard to demographic
characteristics and psychiatric profile (Table 1).
Most subjects had a first-degree relative with major
depression and were experiencing their first episode of
major depression. The mean duration of the current
depressive episode was more than 1 year, with a mean
baseline HAM-D total score between 18 and 19. Features
of melancholic or endogenous depression were exhibited
by 35% to 40% of patients, and 20% had features of
atypical depression. Despite exclusion criteria that limited
many comorbid conditions, psychiatric comorbidity
was common. Comorbid anxiety disorders, such as separation
anxiety and social anxiety disorder, and externalizing
disorders were present at the time of screening in
19% to 28% of subjects.</span>
</p>


<h2 class="pt4">Results:</h2>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Premature Discontinuation:</span>
A total of 190 subjects (69% of 275) completed the 8-
week study. Premature withdrawal rates were 24% for
placebo, 28% for paroxetine (p = .60 versus placebo), and
40% for imipramine (p = .02 versus placebo). Premature
study discontinuation due to adverse effects occurred at a
rate of 6.9% in the placebo group. Study withdrawal due
to adverse effects was the most common reason for discontinuation
in the paroxetine (9.7%; p = .50 versus
placebo) and imipramine (31.5%; p < .01 versus placebo)
groups, respectively. Cardiac adverse effects consisting of
tachycardia (8 patients), postural hypotension (2), prolonged
QT intervals (2), arrhythmia (1), atrioventricular
block (1), abnormal ECG (1), extrasystole (1), and hypertension
(1) led to withdrawal among 14% of subjects in
the imipramine group (13 subjects). Protocol violation,
including lack of compliance, was the most common reason
for withdrawal in the placebo group (8.0%).
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Efficacy Results:</span>
Of the depression-related variables, paroxetine separated
statistically from placebo at endpoint among four
of the parameters: response (i.e., primary outcome measure),
HAM-D depressed mood item, K-SADS-L
depressed mood item, and CGI score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) and trended toward
statistical significance on two measures (K-SADS-L
nine-item depression subscore and mean CGI score)
(Table 2). The response to imipramine was not significantly
different from that for placebo across any of the
seven depression-related variables.
A total of 63.3% of paroxetine subjects (57/90; p = .02
versus placebo), 50% of imipramine subjects (47/94; p =
.57 versus placebo), and 46% of placebo subjects (40/87)
achieved a HAM-D total score of ≤8 at endpoint (Fig. 1).
The time course of response in mean HAM-D total score
is shown in Figure 2. Among patients who completed 8
weeks of treatment, 76.1% of paroxetine subjects (51/67; <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad12.png" alt="">
p = .02 versus placebo), 64.3% of imipramine subjects
(36/56; p = .44 versus placebo), and 57.6% of placebo
subjects (38/66) achieved a mean HAM-D total score of
≤8. In the paroxetine group, 65.6% of patients were considered
very much or much improved on the CGI (p =
.02 versus placebo); rates for the imipramine and placebo
groups were 52.1% (p = .64 versus placebo) and 48.3%,
respectively. Improvement in baseline depressed mood as
measured by the HAM-D and the K-SADS-L depressed
mood items was significantly greater than placebo in the
paroxetine group, but not significantly greater than
placebo in the imipramine group. Improvements in the
K-SADS-L depression subscore (p = .07) and mean CGI
score (p = .09) trended toward statistical significance in
the paroxetine group, but not in the imipramine group
(p = .98 and p = .90, respectively) (Table 2).
Although neither paroxetine nor imipramine separated
statistically from placebo across the nonsymptom measures
of functioning, health, and behavior, improvements
over baseline were achieved for each active treatment
group. Placebo-treated subjects also improved along the
behavioral measures, but to a lesser extent than patients in
the active treatment groups.
</p>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Dosage Titration:</span>
Nearly half of subjects in the paroxetine group
remained at the initial starting dose of 20 mg/day (48%).
Mean dose at study endpoint for paroxetine was 28.0 mg
(SD ±8.54 mg) and for imipramine was 205.8 mg (SD ±63.94 mg). The most common “doses” of placebo
(administered as divided doses) were four capsules per
day (31.0%) and six capsules per day (41.4%).

</p>


<p class="pv3 pilly">
<span class="b">Adverse Effects:</span>
Paroxetine was generally well tolerated in this adolescent
population, and most adverse effects were not serious. The
most common adverse effects reported during paroxetine
therapy were headache, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, and
somnolence (Table 3). These occurred at rates that were
similar to rates in the placebo group with the exception of
somnolence, which occurred at rates of 17.2% for paroxetine
and 3.4% for placebo. Dizziness, dry mouth, headache,
nausea, and tachycardia were most commonly
reported during imipramine treatment. Tremor occurred
in 10.8% of paroxetine-, 14.7% of imipramine-, and
2.3% of placebo-treated subjects.
Adverse effects in all treatment groups occurred most
often during the first week of therapy. Dosage reductions
were most often required for somnolence, insomnia, and
restlessness among paroxetine-treated subjects. Dry
mouth, constipation, and tremor were the most common
adverse effects leading to imipramine dose reductions.
Premature withdrawal from the study because of adverse
effects occurred at rates of 9.7% for paroxetine, 31.5% for
imipramine, and 6.9% for placebo. Clinically significant increases or decreases in body weight were not observed
among any of the three treatment arms of this study.
Serious adverse effects occurred in 11 patients in the
paroxetine group, 5 in the imipramine group, and 2 in the
placebo group. An event was defined as serious if it
resulted in hospitalization, was associated with suicidal gestures,
or was described by the treating physician as serious.
The serious adverse effects in the paroxetine group consisted
of headache during discontinuation taper (1 patient)
and various psychiatric events (10 patients): worsening
depression (2); emotional lability (e.g., suicidal ideation/
gestures [5]); conduct problems or hostility (e.g., aggressiveness,
behavioral disturbance in school [2]); and euphoria/
expansive mood (1). Seven patients were hospitalized: 2
with worsening depression, 2 with emotional lability, 2
with conduct problems, and 1 with euphoria. Of the 11
patients, only headache (1 patient) was considered by the
treating investigator to be related to paroxetine treatment.
The 5 serious adverse effects in the imipramine group
consisted of maculopapular rash (1 patient), dyspnea/
chest pain (1), hostility (1), emotional lability (1), and visual
hallucinations/abnormal dreams (1). Two of the adverse
effects (i.e., hallucinations, rash) were considered
related to imipramine. All 5 patients were withdrawn
from the study, and the patients with hostility or emotional
lability were hospitalized. In the placebo group,
emotional lability (1 patient) and worsening depression
(1) were considered serious. The placebo-treated patient
with emotional lability, which was considered to be
related to placebo, was withdrawn from the study.
Of subjects in the imipramine group who stopped
therapy because of adverse effects, nearly one third
(13.7%) did so because of cardiovascular effects, including
tachycardia, postural hypotension, and prolonged
QT interval. Mean standing heart rate increased by 17
bpm over baseline among subjects treated with imipramine.
Neither paroxetine nor placebo was associated
with changes in heart rate.
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Rigor of Development:</span>
This is the first study to compare efficacy of an SSRI
and a tricyclic antidepressant with placebo in the treatment
of major depression in adolescents. Paroxetine was significantly
more effective than placebo with regard to achievement
of both HAM-D total score ≤8, CGI score of 1 (very
much improved) or 2 (much improved), and improvements
in the depressed mood items of the HAM-D and
the K-SADS-L. Paroxetine did not separate statistically
from placebo for K-SADS-L depression subscore, mean
CGI score, or HAM-D total score.
The demonstration of efficacy for paroxetine in this
study is in accordance with findings of open-label studies
of SSRIs (Ambrosini et al., 1999; Apter et al., 1994; Masi
et al., 1997; McConville et al., 1996; Rey-Sanchez and
Gutierrez-Casares, 1997; Rodriguez-Ramos et al., 1996;
Simeon et al., 1998) and results from placebo-controlled
(Emslie et al., 1997) and historical case-control (Strober
et al., 1999) studies. These findings of efficacy for paroxetine
and other SSRIs are notable in that randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Geller et al.,
1990; Hughes et al., 1990; Kashani et al., 1984; Klein
et al., 1998; Kramer and Feiguine, 1981; Kutcher et al.,
1994; Kye et al., 1996; Petti and Law, 1982; Preskorn
et al., 1987) and one meta-analysis (Hazell et al., 1995)
have not shown efficacy for the tricyclic antidepressants
in the treatment of adolescent depression. Because efficacy
has not been demonstrated for the tricyclic antidepressants
and because these agents are associated with an
unacceptably high risk of cardiotoxicity, especially in
children, further controlled studies are not likely to be
conducted. As such, future research involving bupropion
or noradrenergic antidepressants not yet clinically available
will be required to address more fully the question of
preferential efficacy of the SSRIs in this age group.
Our study used a flexible-dose design in which doses
could be adjusted on the basis of clinical response and tolerability.
Roughly half of subjects were maintained at the
paroxetine starting dose of 20 mg. The mean daily dose of
paroxetine in this study, 28 mg, is comparable with that
reported in flexible-dose trials in adults (Claghorn, 1992;
Cohn and Wilcox, 1992; Dunbar et al., 1991; Fabre, 1992;
Feighner and Boyer, 1992; Shrivastava et al., 1992; Smith
and Glaudin, 1992).
The adverse-effect profile of paroxetine in this adolescent
population was concordant with that reported in
studies of adult patients with depression (Claghorn, 1992;
Cohn and Wilcox, 1992; Dunbar et al., 1991; Fabre,
1992; Feighner and Boyer, 1992; Shrivastava et al., 1992;
Smith and Glaudin, 1992). Serious adverse effects were
reported during treatment with paroxetine (11 patients),
imipramine (5), and placebo (2). Because these serious
adverse effects were judged by the investigator to be
related to treatment in only 4 patients (paroxetine, 1; imipramine,
2; placebo, 1), causality cannot be determined
conclusively. Adverse cardiovascular effects were not observed in subjects treated with paroxetine. In contrast,
tachycardia, postural hypotension, and prolongation of
QT intervals during imipramine therapy resulted in treatment
discontinuation in one third of the 31.5% of subjects
who stopped treatment prematurely with the
tricyclic antidepressant.

<span class="b">Limitations:</span>
A high placebo response rate was observed in this study,
which is not unusual for clinical trials of major depression
in either pediatric or adult populations. In studies of pediatric
patients with major depression, placebo response
rates range from 20% to 80% (Birmaher et al., 1998;
Emslie et al., 1997; Geller et al., 1992; Jensen et al., 1992;
Kowatch et al., 1999). Placebo response also is high in
adults with major depression as demonstrated by mean
placebo response rates of approximately 30% to 40% in
short-term studies (Brown, 1994; Schatzberg and
Kraemer, 2000; Trivedi and Rush, 1994).
Several factors possibly contributed to the observed
placebo response rate. A probable contributing factor was
the weekly supportive case management sessions, which
may have contributed to clinical improvement for
patients in the placebo and active-treatment groups.
<img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad13.png" alt="">
In
addition, the lack of a placebo run-in before randomization
may have contributed to a higher placebo response.
Inclusion of patients with externalizing disorders
(e.g., conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder) also
could be argued to have increased the placebo response
rate. A post hoc analysis was conducted to assess this issue.
However, the separate analysis of our database revealed
that response rates to paroxetine, imipramine, and placebo
among patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) were significantly lower than in patients
without ADHD, regardless of treatment group assignment,
including placebo (Birmaher et al., 2000).
The mean HAM-D total score from our sample at
baseline in all three groups was 18 (±0.43), possibly
accounting for the high placebo response. In fact, there
appears to be an inverse relationship between placebo
response in adults and clinical severity of depression.
Adults with less severe depression exhibit greater placebo
response rates than more seriously ill patients. Mild to
moderate depression (i.e., HAM-D total score less than 19 in one
study [Stewart et al., 1983], less than 13 in another [Paykel et al.,
1988]) was associated with no drug–placebo difference in <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad1.png" alt="">
tricyclic antidepressant treatment studies of adult outpatients.
Moreover, in contrast with our study, the mean
baseline HAM-D total scores in short-term adult SSRI
studies range from 23 to 28 (Cohn and Wilcox, 1985;
Dunbar et al., 1991; Feighner and Overø, 1999; Reimherr
et al., 1990; Stark and Hardison, 1985). It is important to
emphasize, however, that comparisons in HAM-D scores
between adults and adolescents may not be valid because
of possible age-related variability in HAM-D.
Another methodological limitation must be acknowledged:
the study was not designed to directly compare
paroxetine with imipramine. The objective of the study
was to determine the efficacy of two antidepressants with
different mechanisms of action. To conduct a traditional
three-arm comparative trial, this study would require
testing at p values of .0167 rather than .05. To power a <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/drug-ad3.png" alt="">
study at this level, it would have been necessary to enroll
a greater number of patients, thus exposing more adolescents
to the potential risks of clinical research.

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Clinical Implications:</span>
Major depression in adolescents is an increasingly recognized
clinical problem that is remarkably understudied.
The majority of treatment studies involve the tricyclic
antidepressants. Because these agents are associated with
poor efficacy and cardiovascular adverse effects, their use
is not recommended. In contrast, there are few large, wellcontrolled
studies of SSRIs in adolescents. Our findings
are therefore relevant to clinicians who are faced with
treatment decisions for depressed adolescents and a relative
paucity of data guiding therapeutic choice. Despite
some methodological limitations, resulting in a high
placebo response rate (outlined above), our study demonstrates
that treatment with paroxetine results in clinically
relevant improvement in depression scores. The
SSRIs are the medications of choice for the treatment of
major depression in adolescents because they are the only
agents that have been shown to be efficacious in this population;
they have a safer side-effect profile than other
antidepressants, particularly in overdose; and they can be
administered once daily. Clinicians should be aware that 8
weeks of treatment may not be sufficient to achieve a full
clinical response, that some patients may benefit from
higher doses, and that some as-yet unidentified groups of
patients (e.g., more severely depressed; non-ADHD) may
exhibit more robust responses to SSRI therapy
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Conclusion:</span>
The findings of this study provide evidence of the
efficacy and safety of the SSRI, paroxetine, in the treatment of adolescent depression. Additional studies are
called for to define the optimal length of therapy and
dose of SSRIs in this population.</span></span>
