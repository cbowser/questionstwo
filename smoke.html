  Under SDWA, EPA’s UIC Program is responsible for ensuring that fluids injected into
  the ground do not endanger USDWs (Underground Source of Drinking Water). The goal of the Phase I study was to assess the
  potential for contamination of USDWs due to the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids
  into coalbed methane wells, and to determine, based on these findings, whether further
  study is warranted.
  EPA’s approach for evaluating the potential for contamination of USDWs was an
  extensive information collection and review of empirical and theoretical data. EPA
  reviewed water quality incidents potentially associated with hydraulic fracturing and
  evaluated the theoretical potential for hydraulic fracturing to affect the quality of USDWs
  through one of two mechanisms:
  1. Direct injection of fracturing fluids into a USDW in which the coal is located,
  or injection of fracturing fluids into a coal seam that is already in hydraulic
  communication with a USDW (e.g., through a natural fracture system).
  2. Creation of a hydraulic connection between the coalbed formation and an
  adjacent USDW..</p>

<span class="point green i f3" onclick="openNav()">In a rush? Here is a summary. </span>
</div>




<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Reported Water Quality Incidents:</span>
Citizens from Wyoming, Montana, Alabama, Virginia, Colorado, and New Mexico
contacted EPA because they were concerned that their water wells were affected by
coalbed methane production. The major geographic areas where citizens reported
experiencing problems due to coalbed methane development are concentrated in the coal
basins with the most coalbed methane activities – the San Juan, Black Warrior, Central
Appalachian, and Powder River Basins. This study was initiated, partly, in response to
those citizens’ concerns. EPA followed-up on letters and telephone calls from citizens
and resulting leads to understand specific complaints and citizens’ concerns.
EPA published a Federal Register notice (66 FR 39396 (USEPA, 2001) requesting
information on water quality incidents believed to be associated with hydraulic fracturing
of coalbed methane wells. EPA notified over 500 local and/or county agencies in areas
with potential coalbed methane production activity to make them aware of the Federal
Register notice requesting information on coalbed methane-related complaints. The
Agency received no information on complaints from these officials.
</p>


<p class="pv3">
EPA reviewed responses and follow-up actions conducted by state agencies to address
groundwater complaints involving coalbed methane. Hydraulic fracturing is not widely
practiced in the Powder River Basin (which includes Wyoming and Montana) and
concerned citizens from that area reported surface water and groundwater quantity
problems rather than specifying hydraulic fracturing as a problem. <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/oil-1.png" alt="">
Studies ofgroundwater quality in the San Juan Basin (which includes parts of Colorado and New
Mexico) do not address hydraulic fracturing directly. However, problems with
groundwater quantity and quality in Colorado may have plausible explanations other than
hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, natural fractures, and poorly constructed,
sealed, or cemented wells used for various purposes, may provide conduits for methane
to move into shallow geologic strata and water wells, or even to surface water (BLM,
1999). The New Mexico Oil Conservation Division reported that citizens began
reporting increased levels of methane in their water wells after coalbed methane
development began in the San Juan Basin. New Mexico initiated a plugging and
abandonment program to seal old, improperly abandoned production wells, which
appears to have mitigated the problem (Chavez, 2001).</p>

<p class="pv3">

  EPA also obtained individual incident reports from Virginia. None of Virginia’s followup
  investigations provided evidence that hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells
  had caused drinking water well problems. Incidents in Alabama were investigated by the
  Alabama Oil and Gas Board, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management, <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/oil-2.png" alt="">
  and EPA Region IV. Samples from drinking water wells did not test positive for

  constituents found in fracturing fluids. After reviewing all the available data and incident
  reports, EPA sees no conclusive evidence that water quality degradation in USDWs is a
  direct result of injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids into coalbed methane wells and
  subsequent underground movement of these fluids.
</p>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Conclusions:</span>
Based on the information collected and reviewed, EPA has concluded that the injection of
hydraulic fracturing fluids into coalbed methane wells poses little or no threat to USDWs
and does not justify additional study at this time. This decision is consistent with the
process outlined in the April, 2001 Final Study Design, in which EPA indicated that it
would determine whether further investigation was needed after analyzing the Phase I
information. Specifically, EPA determined that it would not continue into Phase II of the
study if the investigation found that no hazardous constituents were used in fracturing
fluids, hydraulic fracturing did not increase the hydraulic connection between previously
isolated formations, and reported incidents of water quality degradation were attributed to
other, more plausible causes.
</p>


<p class="pv3 moneyg"><span class="" onmouseenter="playAudio()">
  Although potentially hazardous chemicals may be introduced into USDWs when
  fracturing fluids are injected into coal seams that lie within USDWs, the risk posed to
  USDWs by introduction of these chemicals is reduced significantly by groundwater
  production and injected fluid recovery, combined with the mitigating effects of dilution
  and dispersion, adsorption, and potentially biodegradation. Additionally, EPA has
  reached an agreement with the major service companies to voluntarily eliminate diesel
  fuel from hydraulic fracturing fluids that are injected directly into USDWs for coalbed
  methane production.</span>
</p>

<p class="pv3">
  Often, a high stress contrast between adjacent geologic strata results in a barrier to
fracture propagation. This may occur in those coal zones where there is a geologic
contact between a coalbed and a thick, higher-stress shale that is not highly fractured.
Some studies that allow direct observation of fractures (i.e., mined-through studies)
indicate many fractures that penetrate into, or sometimes through, formations overlying
coalbeds can be attributed to the existence of pre-existing natural fractures. <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/oil-3.png" alt=""> However,
and as noted above, given the concentrations and flowback of injected fluids, and the
mitigating effects of dilution and dispersion, fluid entrapment, and potentially
biodegradation, EPA does not believe that possible hydraulic connections under these
circumstances represent a significant potential threat to USDWs.

<p class="pv3">
EPA also reviewed incidents of drinking water well contamination believed to be
associated with hydraulic fracturing and found no confirmed cases that are linked to
fracturing fluid injection into coalbed methane wells or subsequent underground
movement of fracturing fluids. Although thousands of coalbed methane wells are
fractured annually, EPA did not find confirmed evidence that drinking water wells have
been contaminated by hydraulic fracturing fluid injection into coalbed methane wells.
