<p class="pv3">
The relationship between sugar and health is complex due to multiple interrelated variables, including state of energy balance, macronutrient substitutions, and underlying diet and lifestyle patterns. Existing evidence of a link between sugar intake and adverse health outcomes has been translated into dietary guidance and recommendations for the general public by authoritative health organizations. Dietary guidance addresses the types of sugars, especially sources of nonintrinsic sugars, such as added sugars and free sugars. Added sugars consist of monosaccharides and disaccharides added during the production and preparation of foods and beverages and do not include sugars naturally found in milk, fruit, and fruit juice. Free sugars comprise sugars added to products as well as sugars naturally found in fruit, honey, and syrup.</p>

<p class="pv3">
As research continues to add knowledge, authoritative organizations have issued public health guidance based on the available evidence. Recent guidelines have included both qualitative and quantitative recommendations that consistently focus on limiting and reducing sugar consumption, especially sources of nonintrinsic sugars. For example, in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued public health guidelines (PHGs) with specific recommendations for dietary sugar intake. Each organization conducted its own review of the available evidence and published its recommendations, including the scientific basis for its conclusions. These organizations have crafted different recommendations with regard to sugar consumption, with various rationales for limiting intake.

When respected organizations issue conflicting recommendations, it can result in confusion and raises concern about the quality of the guidelines and the underlying evidence. We conducted a systematic survey and critical appraisal of authoritative PHGs, including an assessment of the quality of evidence supporting recommendations for dietary sugar intake.

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Methods:</span>
We registered the protocol for this systematic review in the PROSPERO database in November 2015 (registration number CRD42015029182) (7).
Data Sources and Searches
Using a search strategy developed with the help of an experienced librarian, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science (1995 to September 2016) using subject terms and keywords. We searched 5 gray literature sources, including Google (Appendix Table 1), as well as bibliographies of included studies. We consulted with 3 experts in the field of carbohydrates (Appendix Table 1) to identify additional guidelines we may have missed. Our search was restricted to English-language guidelines.
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Study Selection:</span>
Our criteria for inclusion were 1) PHGs, defined as documents developed by a nationally recognized committee, a publicly funded institution, or a medical society that provided recommendations for sugar intake in the general population; 2) inclusion of an explicit methodology section, either within the guideline or in supporting documents (for example, definition of the search strategy, evidence quality assessment, and methods used to create recommendations); 3) the most recent version of publications from an organization; and 4) publication between 1995 and 2016.
Our target outcomes of interest were the overall quality of development of the PHGs; the consistency of sugar recommendations, both quantitative and qualitative; the strength of the recommendations; an assessment of the supporting evidence for each recommendation; the use of systematic review methods; explicit links between recommendations and supporting evidence; and the strengths and limitations of the body of evidence.</p>



<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Data Extraction and Quality Assessment:</span>
Two reviewers (B.S. and J.E.) independently screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and data extracted from included PHGs by using standardized, pilot-tested forms. We abstracted the following guideline characteristics: title, year, authors, language, organization, whether it was a novel publication or an update, location of development, the recommendations for sugar intake along with the strength of each recommendation, and the authors’ assessment of the quality of the supporting evidence. Pairs of reviewers (B.S., J.E., L.L., and B.C.J.) <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad6.png" alt=""> independently identified, extracted, and appraised references to the evidence used to justify each recommendation, including the types of sugars (for example, added, free, or total) referenced in the supporting body of literature. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus and, if consensus could not be reached, consulted with senior scientists (B.C.J. and J.S.).
Three reviewers (B.S., J.E., and L.L.) <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad7.png" alt=""> independently appraised guidelines by using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, 2nd edition (AGREE II), instrument, comprising 23 items within 6 domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence (Appendix Table 2) (8). In addition, 2 overall assessments were completed for each PHG: a score of 1 to 7, <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad8.png" alt=""> and whether the reviewer would recommend using the guideline (recommended, recommended with modifications, or not recommended). We conducted a calibration exercise using 2 guidelines to ensure consistency and validity and resolved disagreements by consensus. Item rating differences of 3 points or fewer between reviewers were permitted. Senior scientists (B.C.J. and J.S.) were available for discrepancies but were not needed.<sup class="popup dib b red" onclick="myFunction()">1 <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup"><img class="mw-100 shadow-1" src="/images/coke-funding2.png" alt=""> </span>
</p>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Quality Appraisal of Evidence Used in Guidelines:</span>
We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (9) to independently assess the quality of the evidence underlying each recommendation. For each target outcome linked to a recommendation, GRADE assigns the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. Systematic reviews of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) started with high quality of evidence, whereas systematic reviews of observational studies started with low quality. In instances where only single studies for recommendations were cited, RCTs started with moderate-quality evidence and observational studies started with very-low-quality evidence. <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad9.png" alt=""> For each body of evidence (systematic reviews) and for each citation (single studies), where possible, we considered downgrading the quality of evidence on the basis of 5 domains: risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, inconsistency, and publication bias. Subsequently, we considered rating up on the basis of 3 domains: large effect size, dose–response, and an absence of residual or unmeasured confounding.
</p>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Data Synthesis and Analysis:</span>
Agreement for the full-text screening was calculated using the κ statistic and its 95% CI (10). For each guideline, we calculated the AGREE II score for each domain as a percentage of the maximum possible score and standardized range. We considered 60% as a threshold of acceptable quality. Interrater agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient with corresponding 95% CIs (11). <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad10.png" alt=""> Agreement of 0.01 to 0.20 was considered poor, 0.21 to 0.40 was considered fair, 0.41 to 0.60 was considered moderate, 0.61 to 0.80 was considered substantial, and 0.81 to 1.00 was considered very good (12). For all AGREE II domains across all PHGs, we calculated the median domain score and the interquartile range (IQR). All analyses were conducted using Excel 2013 (Microsoft).

<span class="" onmouseenter="playAudio()"><span class="b">Role of the Funding Source:</span>
This study was supported by the Technical Committee on Dietary Carbohydrates of the North American branch of the <span class="i">International Life Sciences Institute</span> (ILSI North America). ILSI North America is a public, nonprofit foundation that provides a forum to advance understanding of scientific issues related to the nutritional quality and safety of the food supply by sponsoring research programs, educational seminars and workshops, and publications. ILSI North America receives 60% of its financial support from its more than 400 industry members. The authors wrote the protocol, which was reviewed for scope clarifications and approved by ILSI. The funding source had no role in the conduct of the review or the interpretation of data, manuscript review, or publication decisions.</span>
</p>



<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Results:</span>
A total of 5315 records were screened, 26 records were considered potentially eligible for full-text screening, and 9 PHGs proved eligible (Figure). Eligible guidelines included 1 global guideline (4), 2 international guidelines (13, 14), and 6 national guidelines (5, 6, 15–18). Guidelines were published from 2002 to 2015 by the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (6), WHO (4), SACN and Public Health England (5), the Ministry of Health of Brazil (15), the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (18), the Nordic Council of Ministers (14), the German Nutrition Society (16), the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (17), and the Institute of Medicine (13) (Table 1).
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Recommendation Characteristics:</span>
The 9 PHGs provided a total of 12 recommendations on dietary sugar intake. All recommendations advocated for reduced intake of nonintrinsic free or added sugars and/or decreased consumption of foods and beverages high in refined sugars, and 5 recommendations provided specific sugar intake limits (Table 1). Guidelines used variable terminology in sugar recommendations. For example, 2 guidelines used the term “free sugars” (4, 5), 3 used the term “added sugars” (6, 13, 14), 2 made recommendations on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (5, 16), and 3 referred to food and beverage sources of <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad5.png" alt=""> refined sugars (15, 17, 18). Quantitative recommendations ranged from less than 5% of total energy from free sugars (4, 5) to less than 25% of total energy from added sugars (13). The rationale for decreased sugar intake included nutrient displacement, excess energy intake, dental caries, bone health, weight gain, and obesity. Four guidelines assessed the quality of the evidence and used the assessment to develop their recommendations (4, 5, 16, 18), and 5 did not (6, 13, 15, 17, 19).

</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Scope and Purpose:</span>
Items in this domain evaluate the overall objectives, related health questions, and the target population of the guideline (20). Across guidelines, the median score for this domain was 81.5% (IQR, 72.2% to 88.0%), indicating that most items were highly rated (Table 2). Eight of the 9 guidelines reached the 60% threshold for reporting. The main limitation across all guidelines was the description of expected benefit, or outcomes, of the guidelines.

</p>


<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Stakeholder Involvement:</span>
Stakeholder involvement criteria focus on the extent of involvement of appropriate participants in the guideline development process and whether it reflects the views of its intended users (20). The median score for this domain was 63.0% (IQR, 38.9% to 77.8%) (Table 2). Four guidelines scored below 60% in this domain (5, 13, 16, 17). Many guidelines did not describe how they sought the views and preferences of their target population (patients or the public), and those that did were vague about the process.
</p>




<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Rigor of Development:</span>
Rigor of development relates to the methods used for gathering and synthesizing the evidence for guideline development, formulation of the recommendations, and the process for updating the guideline (20). The median score for this domain was low, at 47.2% (IQR, 24.0% to 69.4%) (Table 2). Three of the guidelines met the 60% threshold (4, 6, 18). Four guidelines did not use systematic methods to search for evidence (6, 13, 15, 17). Four guidelines assigned strength to their recommendations (4, 6, 16, 18), but only the WHO guideline used the GRADE approach (4). Three of the guidelines discussed external review by experts before publication (4, 6, 18). Two guidelines appropriately described the process for updating recommendations (4, 6).
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Clarity of Presentation:</span>
Clarity of presentation relates to whether key recommendations are unambiguous and easily identifiable in the guideline (20). The median score for this domain was 59.3% (IQR, 49.1% to 71.3%), with 4 guidelines meeting the 60% threshold (6, 13, 17, 18) (Table 2). The main limitation in this domain was that the different options for management of the health issue (for example, ways to limit sugar intake) were not clearly presented.
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Applicability:</span>
Items in the applicability domain focus on the likely barriers to and facilitators of implementation, strategies to improve uptake, and resource implications of applying the guideline (20). The median score for this domain was low, at 34.7% (IQR, 11.1% to 50.0%) (Table 2). Only 1 guideline met the 60% threshold (18). The most common issue was failing to discuss the facilitators and barriers to the guideline’s application and failing to address the resource implications of applying the recommendations. Only 1 guideline (4) presented monitoring and auditing criteria.
</p>

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Editorial Independence:</span>
Editorial independence relates to unbiased formulation of recommendations and competing interests (20). This domain had the lowest median score (33.3% [IQR, 6.9% to 65.3%]), with only 2 guidelines meeting the 60% threshold (Table 2). Most of the guidelines either did not provide a statement about funding and its influence in the process of guideline development or failed to state conflicts of interest of authors or the guideline panel. <span class="point kettle red i f5"><img class="dib mw-100 w-10" src="/images/kettle.png" alt="pot calling kettle black">  <span class="f5 red fs-normal ibm">...and yet a co-author of this study forgot to mention the $25,000 grant they previously received from Coke and their involvement in numerous studies of sugar funded by Coke and Pepsi...</span></span>
</p>




<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Overall Assessment:</span>
Overall guideline quality was moderate (median score, 4.0 [IQR, 3.7 to 4.8]), with only the Australian guideline meeting the 60% threshold for all 6 domains. Scores ranged from 3.3 (German guideline [16]) to 5.3 (Australian guideline [18]) (Table 2). All of the guidelines were categorized as “recommended with modifications.”
</p>




<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Quality Assessment of Supporting Evidence for Recommendations: GRADE Results:</span>
There were a total of 66 unique publications across 9 eligible guidelines supporting the 12 dietary sugar recommendations. Evidence included systematic reviews; RCTs; nonrandomized, controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; case–control studies; national surveys; and cross-sectional studies (Appendix Table 4). The Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population and the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans did not cite any previously published studies as evidence for their recommendations (6, 15), and Public Health England conducted its own systematic reviews for its Carbohydrates and Health report that have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal but were publicly available (5).
Sixteen systematic reviews were used to inform 7 recommendations across 5 guidelines (4, 5, 14, 16, 18) (Appendix Table 5). Evidence was low to very low for each systematic review. Fourteen reviews (87.5%) were downgraded for inconsistency, 11 (68.8%) were downgraded for imprecision, 2 (14%) were downgraded for publication bias, and 2 (12.5%) were downgraded for indirectness.


<img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad11.png" alt=""> Two large RCTs (21, 22), both on SSBs and body weight, informed 2 recommendations from the German and Australian guidelines (16, 18) (Appendix Table 5). Our independent review indicated that the evidence was of very low quality for both and was downgraded for imprecision (wide CIs and trivial treatment effects based on the lower bound of the 95% CI) and indirectness. Eight small RCTs (less than 300 events for dichotomous outcomes or less than 400 participants for continuous outcomes) started at moderate quality and were all downgraded to very low quality due to imprecision and indirectness. Eight large cohort studies (Appendix Table 5), all on SSBs and health outcomes (such as type 2 diabetes and body weight), informed 3 recommendations across the Nordic, German, and Australian guidelines (14, 16, 18). Evidence was considered very low quality for 6 studies (75%) (23–28) and low quality for 2 studies (25%) (29, 30). Three studies were downgraded for indirectness (37.5%), and 2 were downgraded for imprecision (25%). Two studies were rated up for a dose–response (25%) (29, 30). Twenty-eight small cohort studies started at very low quality, and we did not rate up given their imprecision and indirectness.


Although a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee drafted an extensive scientific report (31) to inform the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (6), the guidelines cited food pattern modeling and U.S. national caloric intake data from added sugars to inform recommendations. <img class="dib mw-100 smallguy zoomed" src="/images/sugar-ad12.png" alt=""> We planned to use GRADE to evaluate the quality of the evidence used in the model components as well as the accuracy of the modeling procedure; however, these details were not publicly available, and we were unable to assess the quality of the evidence for the recommendations.
The WHO guideline was the only one to use the GRADE approach (9). The WHO conducted 2 systematic reviews, one of which included observational studies evaluating effects of free sugars on dental caries (assessed as moderate-quality by the WHO and graded up for large effect size) and the other including RCTs and observational studies evaluating effects of free sugars on body weight (assessed as moderate-quality by the WHO and downgraded for publication bias). Although the WHO guideline recommendations are for free sugars, included studies among both systematic reviews used various forms of sugar, including sucrose, added sugars, and total sugars for the dental caries review (32) and free sugars, SSBs, fructose, sucrose, sweet foods, and added sugars for the body weight review (33). Similar discrepancies were found in 5 additional guidelines (Table 1).
We independently reviewed the WHO evidence profiles and deemed the quality of evidence on sugars and body weight to be low (with additional downgrading for inconsistency). We also reasoned that the evidence on sugar and dental caries was low (unlike WHO’s rationale, we did not rate up for a large effect size). The WHO issued a strong recommendation to reduce free sugars to less than 10% of daily caloric intake based on 5 cohort studies (1200 children) assessing the risk for dental caries and a weak recommendation to reduce free sugars to less than 5% of daily caloric intake based on 3 ecological studies on the risk for dental caries.

<p class="pv3">
<span class="b">Discussion:</span>
We identified 9 PHGs containing 12 dietary sugar recommendations. The quality of development of the guidelines (assessed using the AGREE II instrument) was moderate, with 3 of 6 AGREE II domains (rigor of development, applicability, and editorial independence) having major limitations. Seven recommendations were qualitative, whereas 5 were quantitative, ranging from less than 5% to less than 25% of total calories from nonintrinsic sugars per day. The rationale for the varied sugar intake recommendations was based primarily on nutrient displacement, dental caries, and weight gain.
Using the GRADE approach, we found that the overall quality of evidence to support recommendations was low to very low. Optimal guidelines should be developed with increased rigor, and recommendations should be specific (population, exposure, comparator group, and outcomes critically important to the general public) and transparent (including explicit conflicts of interest and how the body of evidence was considered for developing each recommendation) and should follow GRADE guidance as intended (weak recommendations if the quality of evidence is low, with few exceptions [34]).</p>

<p class="pv3">
A PubMed search for reviews of dietary sugar guidelines done within the past 5 years identified only 1 other review. Although Hess and colleagues (2) reviewed dietary sugar recommendations around the world, the search was not systematic and the review did not assess the quality of the guidelines or the supporting evidence. The authors concluded that no clear link exists between added sugar intake and health outcomes.
The included guidelines examined the potential health effects of sugars and risk for dental caries, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The WHO and SACN suggested that a strong correlation exists between overall free sugars and health outcomes (4, 5). In both guidelines, most of the cited evidence examined SSB consumption and health outcomes rather than the consumption of free sugars from various foods.
Our review had limitations. This project was funded by ILSI, an organization that is funded primarily by the food and agriculture industry. The authors, having expertise in study methodology (particularly in the development of practice guidelines), wrote the protocol and conducted the study independent of the funding body. However, given our funding source, our study team has a financial conflict of interest and readers should consider our results carefully.</p>

<p class="pv3">
We initially sought to assess the quality of the evidence underlying the recommendations by using the Oxford Levels of Evidence, as indicated in our publicly available protocol. Post hoc, we chose to use the GRADE approach, wherein a body of evidence is categorized using intuitive language (high, moderate, low, or very low quality) and each category is accompanied by an explicit definition. In contrast, the Oxford Levels of Evidence uses numbers associated with specific study designs based on the traditional hierarchy of evidence. We believe that the Oxford Levels of Evidence gives a false impression of the evidence (for example, a systematic review of RCTs rated as level 1 evidence despite potentially serious limitations when comprehensively assessed using the GRADE approach). With GRADE methods, the evidence can be rated up or down on the basis of a set of criteria (such as precision, risk of bias, and publication bias). The criteria are applied using a systematic and explicit approach that includes extensive instructions and transparency with respect to the quality assessment. We believe that the use of GRADE reduces the likelihood of mislabeling the overall certainty of evidence.
Only 9 guidelines that explicitly reported their methods were included in this review. Given our focused eligibility criteria, this was not a review of all available dietary sugar recommendations that may influence the beliefs and actions of the public, regulators, and health care practitioners. For example, we identified 4 publications (35–38) containing dietary sugar recommendations written by influential organizations (American Academy of Pediatrics, European Food Safety Authority, American Heart Association, and India National Institute of Nutrition) that were excluded because they lacked a written methodology section. We did not include these reports because a comprehensive understanding of the methods used to develop a PHG is essential to assessing the quality of the development of a guideline and the quality of evidence for recommendations. We also excluded PHGs that were not published in English. Although our review included guidelines from around the world, it was not a comprehensive review of all potentially available guidelines.
</p>

<p class="pv3">
Our review also had several strengths. A priori, we documented our eligibility criteria, objectives, and planned methods of analysis as publicly registered on PROSPERO (7). We independently assessed the quality of development of dietary guidelines by using AGREE II and the certainty of evidence for sugar recommendations by using the GRADE framework, which has been endorsed by more than 90 health organizations worldwide (39). On the basis of our methodological analysis of PHGs, we believe the range of various recommendations and the evidence that supports these recommendations can be better interpreted by health care professionals and consumers trying to design effective programs and provide guidance to the public about sugar intake.
All of the reviewed guidelines suggested a decrease in consumption of nonintrinsic sugars. Although the overall direction was consistent, the rationale and evidence used to make each recommendation were inconsistent. This lack of evidentiary consistency, with various health concerns cited, creates confusion for practitioners and the public about the role that sugar plays in health.
Quantitative limits on sugar intake were recommended in 5 of the 9 PHGs (4–6, 13, 14). Each of the quantitative sugar recommendations (except the WHO recommendation) was based on an estimate of how much sugar could be consumed while maintaining a “healthy diet.” For example, the Dietary Reference Intakes and the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans set limits of less than 25% and less than 10% of energy from added sugars, respectively (6, 13), based on diet modeling and intake data. Similarly, the SACN recommendation was based on the desired energy reduction of 100 calories per day for effective population-wide weight loss. An approximated 100 calories of free sugars was subtracted from the previous sugar recommendation to obtain this 100-calorie deficit, resulting in the specified maximal intake of 5% of total energy from free sugars (5). The method by which the Nordic Council of Ministers determined a limit of 10% of energy from added sugars was not explained in its PHG (14). In contrast, the WHO used 5 cohort studies (moderate quality) and 3 ecological studies (very low quality) on the risk for dental caries to set the limit of intake of free sugars to below 10% and 5% of total energy intake (4).
The quality of available evidence to link sugar with health outcomes was generally rated as low to very low. The prevailing concerns with high sugar intake are directed toward excessive calorie consumption and nutrient displacement. Sugar added to products adds considerable calories without any nutritional benefits and may take the place of other nutrient-dense foods in the diet. From a practical standpoint, added sugars are a source of calories that many public health authorities believe can be easily reduced. Doing so at a population level may result in a reduction in caloric intake and a subsequent decrease in the rate of overweight and obesity. At present, there seems to be no reliable evidence indicating that any of the recommended daily caloric thresholds for sugar intake are strongly associated with negative health effects. The results from this review should be used to promote improvement in the development of trustworthy guidelines on sugar intake (40).
